# Knowledge Base Search Engine (KBSE)

A professional, production-ready README for the Knowledge Base Search Engine (KBSE). KBSE is a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system that provides context-aware answers over document collections by combining semantic search (embeddings + FAISS) with an LLM.

This document contains an overview, ASCII architecture diagram, quickstart, operational guidance, and troubleshooting notes to run or extend the project.

## Why this project matters

- Accelerates knowledge discovery across unstructured documents
- Produces explainable answers by returning supporting document snippets
- Modular architecture allows swapping embedding or LLM providers without rework

## High-level Features

- Document ingestion (PDF, TXT) with robust text extraction
- Chunking and contextual embeddings
- Scalable similarity search using FAISS
- Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to synthesize answers with citations
- Clear separation between ingestion, indexing, retrieval, and generation components

```

## Quickstart (macOS / Linux)

Prerequisites

- Python 3.10+ (3.11 recommended)
- Git
- Virtual environment (venv or conda)
- API keys for your chosen embedding/LLM provider (set via environment variables)

Steps

1) Clone the repository

	git clone
	cd KNOWLEDGE_BASE_SEARCH_ENGINE

2) Create and activate a virtual environment (zsh)

	python3 -m venv .venv
	source .venv/bin/activate

3) Install dependencies

	pip install -r requirements.txt

4) Export provider credentials (example for OpenAI)

	export OPENAI_API_KEY="your_api_key_here"

5) Start the server

	python app.py

Default server endpoint: http://localhost:5000 (or configured host/port in `app.py`).

## Typical developer workflow

1. Upload documents via the UI or `/upload` endpoint.
2. Ingestion extracts text, chunking occurs, and embeddings are computed.
3. Embeddings are stored in FAISS and metadata in `index.pkl`.
4. A user query is embedded and FAISS returns k-nearest chunks.
5. The RAG synthesizer asks the LLM to produce an answer with citations.

## Important files and directories

- `app.py` â€” Main application server and endpoints
- `requirements.txt` â€” Python package dependencies
- `faiss_index/` â€” FAISS index and metadata (`index.faiss`, `index.pkl`)
- `KBSE-clean/` â€” Alternate/cleaned copy of the project

If you change the embedding or LLM provider, update the provider adapter in the codebase and ensure environment variables are set accordingly.

## Operational guidance

- Run the server behind a WSGI/ASGI server (Gunicorn/Uvicorn) and use Nginx as a reverse proxy for production.
- Persist FAISS indices to durable storage; rebuild indices when ingesting new large datasets.
- Limit file upload sizes and validate file types to reduce attack surface.

## Troubleshooting

- "Index file missing": Run the ingestion script to recreate `faiss_index/index.faiss` and `index.pkl`.
- "Slow queries": Use a more appropriate FAISS index type (HNSW or IVF+PQ) or increase RAM/IO throughput.
- "Irrelevant answers": Increase retrieval top-k, tune chunk size/overlap, or improve prompt templates.

## Next steps (recommended)

- Add an end-to-end test that uploads a sample document and validates answers for known queries.
# Knowledge Base Search Engine (KBSE)

KBSE is a focused Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system that delivers concise, context-aware answers over document collections by combining semantic search (embeddings + FAISS) with an LLM.

This README is intentionally concise and practical: overview, architecture, quickstart, operational guidance, and extension recommendations.

## Core value proposition

- Fast semantic retrieval across unstructured document sets
- Explainable answers with cited source snippets
- Modular components: ingestion, indexing, retrieval, and generation

## Key features

- Robust ingestion for PDF and plain-text files
- Configurable chunking strategy (window size & overlap)
- Pluggable embedding provider (OpenAI or local models)
- FAISS vector store for efficient nearest-neighbour search
- RAG pipeline to synthesize answers from retrieved context

## Quickstart (macOS / Linux)

Prerequisites

- Python 3.10+ (3.11 recommended)
- Git
- Virtual environment (venv or conda)
- API key(s) for your chosen embedding/LLM provider

Setup

1) Clone the repository

```bash
git clone 
cd KNOWLEDGE_BASE_SEARCH_ENGINE
```

2) Create and activate a venv (zsh)

```bash
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
```

3) Install dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

4) Configure provider credentials (example)

```bash
export OPENAI_API_KEY="your_api_key_here"
```

5) Start the API

```bash
python app.py
```

Open http://localhost:5000 (or the host/port in `app.py`) to access the UI.

## Typical workflow

1. Upload documents via the UI or API.
2. Ingestion extracts text, chunks content, and computes embeddings.
3. Embeddings and metadata are persisted in FAISS and `index.pkl`.
4. For queries: compute a query embedding, retrieve top-k candidates, assemble context, and generate an answer with the LLM.

## Important files & directories

- `app.py` â€” API server and endpoints
- `requirements.txt` â€” Python dependencies
- `faiss_index/` â€” FAISS binary index and metadata (`index.faiss`, `index.pkl`)
- `KBSE-clean/` â€” alternate project copy

## Operational guidance

- Production: run behind Uvicorn/Gunicorn with Nginx and supervise with systemd.
- Persist FAISS indices to fast durable storage and back them up regularly.
- Enforce upload size/type limits and sanitize content.
- Do not commit secrets; use environment variables or a secrets manager.

## Troubleshooting

- "Index file missing": run ingestion to recreate `faiss_index/index.faiss` and `index.pkl`.
- "Slow retrieval": tune FAISS index type (HNSW / IVF+PQ) or adjust nprobe / index parameters.
- "Poor answer quality": increase top-k retrieval, adjust chunking overlap, or refine prompt templates.

## Recommended next steps

- Add a minimal React frontend to showcase the end-to-end flow.
- Introduce an automated test that ingests a sample document and verifies expected answers.
- Add CI to run linting and smoke tests on pull requests.

If you want, I can also add a small FAISS health-check script or scaffold a minimal React frontend. Tell me which you'd prefer next.
